## Overview
This is a Flask web app which predicts price of old car price.

## Motivation
I started to learn Machine Learning model to get most out of it. I came to know mathematics behind all supervised models. Finally it is important to work on application (real world application) to actually make a difference.

## Installation
The Code is written in Python. If you don't have Python installed you can find it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).To install the required packages and libraries, run this command in the project directory cloning the repository:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
